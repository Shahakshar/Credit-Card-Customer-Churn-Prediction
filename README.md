#Binary Classification for Credit Card Adoption


This project builds a neural network model to predict whether a customer will accept a credit card or not. Using customer attributes like age, income, credit score, and account balance, the model classifies responses into two categories (Yes/No). The network consists of hidden layers with ReLU activation and a sigmoid output layer for binary classification. It is trained using binary cross-entropy loss and optimized with Adam. The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy helping financial institutions improve targeted marketing and decision-making. ðŸš€
